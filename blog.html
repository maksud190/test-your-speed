        <h3 class="text-warning">Difference between localstorage and sessionstorage</h3>
        <p><span class="text-success">Answer:</span> sessionStorage is similar to localStorage. The difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab</p>

        <h3 class="text-warning">Difference between global scope and block scope</h3>
        <p><span class="text-success">Answer:</span> In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the window object while in Node. js, it's controlled by the global object. Block scopes are what I get when I use if statements, for statements, and the like.</p>

        <h3 class="text-warning">How does javascript event loop work?</h3>
        <p><span class="text-success">Answer:</span> The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>
